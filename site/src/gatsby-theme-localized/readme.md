# Shadowed folder 

This is a shadow folder of **gatsby-theme-localized** theme.

Any file that exists in the original theme can be replaced here.

This means that `site/src/gatsby-theme-localized/components/Component.js` will be rendered in place of `gatsby-theme-blog/src/components/Component.js`

In this particular starter we are using shadowing to override the original translations for example.
